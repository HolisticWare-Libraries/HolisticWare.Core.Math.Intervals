# HolisticWare.Core.Math.Intervals

Mathematical Interval/Range implementation for .NET Standard 1.0.

Interval (mathematics), also called Range, a set of numbers (not only real) that includes all numbers 
between any two numbers in the set.

Interval is implemented as generic class taking numerics (usharp, sharp, uint, int, ulong, long, float, 
double and decimal) as well as DateTime.

```csharp

    Interval<int> interval_of_ints = new Interval<int>("[1,10]");

```
